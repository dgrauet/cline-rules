# Global Cline Rules Index

This master index provides navigation and relationship mapping for all Cline global rules across workspaces.

## Quick Navigation

### üèõÔ∏è Meta-Governance
- **[Meta-Governance Framework](META_GOVERNANCE.md)** - Rules about rules, precedence, and governance

### üîß Core Methodology
- **[Baby Steps‚Ñ¢ Methodology](baby-steps.md)** - Fundamental operational principles
- **[Task Handoff Strategy](new-task-automation.md)** - Context window management

### üìö Universal Standards
- **[Documentation Standards](documentation-standards.md)** - Universal documentation practices
- **[Documentation Accuracy](documentation-accuracy.md)** - Anti-marketing hype and factual accuracy
- **[Coding Standards](coding-standards.md)** - Universal coding guidelines
- **[Cline Rules Templates](rule-templates.md)** - Standardized rule creation templates

## Rule Hierarchy Structure

### Level 1: Meta-Governance Rules (Highest Priority)
- **You MUST** understand governance rules before implementing any Cline rules
- **You MUST** apply cross-cutting governance to all rule operations  
- **You SHOULD** use META_GOVERNANCE.md for all governance decisions

### Level 2: Core Methodology Rules (High Priority)
- **You MUST** follow Baby Steps‚Ñ¢ methodology for all Cline operations
- **You MUST** use task handoff strategy for context management
- **You SHOULD** apply behavioral patterns consistently across all projects

### Level 3: Universal Standards (High Priority)
- **You MUST** follow documentation standards for all Cline documentation
- **You MUST** avoid marketing hype and maintain accuracy
- **You MUST** use coding standards for all implementation work

### Implementation Dependencies
- **You MUST** use META_GOVERNANCE.md as the foundation for all rule governance
- **You SHOULD** follow dependency chain when implementing rules
- **You MUST NOT** skip prerequisite rules in the dependency hierarchy

## Search Tags

- **#meta-governance** - You MUST use for governance decisions and rule precedence
- **#methodology** - You MUST follow for all operational procedures and task execution
- **#standards** - You MUST apply for coding, documentation, and quality standards
- **#accuracy** - You MUST maintain for all technical communications and rule accuracy
- **#templates** - You MUST use when creating new rules and documentation
- **#workflow** - You MUST follow for process automation and task completion

## Rule Relationships

### Core Dependencies
- **You MUST NOT** implement rules without understanding their dependencies
- **You SHOULD** maintain cross-reference relationships between all rules
- **You MUST** validate rule relationships when making changes

### Documentation Ecosystem
- **You MUST** maintain consistent documentation standards across all rules
- **You SHOULD** update cross-references when modifying rule relationships
- **You MUST NOT** create rules that contradict established governance patterns

## Quality Metrics

- **You MUST** maintain at least 7 global rules for complete coverage
- **You SHOULD** achieve 100% cross-reference connectivity
- **You MUST** keep all rules current with version and review dates

## Rule Validation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] You MUST use the meta-governance framework for all rule decisions
- [x] You MUST apply Baby Steps methodology to all operations
- [x] You MUST implement task handoff strategy for context management
- [x] You SHOULD maintain cross-reference system connectivity
- [x] You MUST follow documentation standards for all rule content

### üìã Next Phase
- [ ] You SHOULD update workspace governance framework monthly
- [ ] You MUST migrate deprecated rules within 30 days
- [ ] You MUST validate rule relationships quarterly
- [ ] You SHOULD test both validation and health monitoring weekly

---

**You MUST** follow all governance rules and update this index when rules change.

## Cross-References

### Depends On
- **[META_GOVERNANCE.md](META_GOVERNANCE.md)** - You MUST follow governance framework for rule organization and maintenance
- **[Cline Rules Templates](rule-templates.md)** - You MUST follow standardized templates for rule creation and structure

### Extends
- **Navigation Framework**: You MUST use for discovery and navigation of all global Cline rules
- **Rule Relationship System**: You SHOULD maintain dependencies and relationships between rules in the ecosystem

### See Also
- **[Baby Steps‚Ñ¢ Methodology](baby-steps.md)** - You MUST apply core operational principles for all rule usage
- **[Documentation Standards](documentation-standards.md)** - You MUST follow universal documentation practices for rule content
- **[Documentation Accuracy Standards](documentation-accuracy.md)** - You MUST maintain anti-hype standards for rule communications
- **[Coding Standards](coding-standards.md)** - You MUST follow universal coding guidelines for rule implementation
- **[Task Handoff Strategy](new-task-automation.md)** - You MUST use context management for rule usage and transitions

### Replaces
- **Ad-hoc Rule Discovery**: You MUST use systematic approach to rule discovery and navigation
- **Manual Rule Relationship Mapping**: You SHOULD automate and maintain rule dependencies and cross-references

### Conflicts With
- **None**: This index file complements all other rules and provides essential navigation and relationship mapping
- **Resolution**: You MUST keep navigation current when rules are added, modified, or deprecated

## Implementation Requirements
- **You MUST** maintain current rule relationships and dependencies
- **You SHOULD** update navigation structure when new rules are added
- **You MUST** validate cross-references for accuracy before publishing
- **You SHOULD** document significant changes to rule ecosystem
- **You MUST NOT** publish rules without proper cross-reference validation
